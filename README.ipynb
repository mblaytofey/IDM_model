    "## IDM_model : for CDD and CRDM tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts located in the [src](src) directory, were written to sequentially do the following two items: \n",
    "1. Split the data collected in the IDM project into corresponding directories, using [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format.\n",
    "2. Using the files saved in the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format to analyze CRDM and CDD data by estimating the utility models. \n",
    "\n",
    "** *update* **\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapted the code to separate the two items above so we could analyze the CRDM and CDD data independently. This requires that the datafiles are stored in the appropriate [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format.\n",

    "\n",
    "**NOTE** :: Batch modeling was written to analyze the IDM project recorded online. If you have the CRDM and CDD task files already saved as separate spreadsheets (.csv) use the two functions in Step 2a above.\n",
